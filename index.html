<h1>Business card bootstrapped in Ruby code</h1>

<p>A ruby script that generates the SVG image that is my <a
href="http://github.com/ErikSchlyter/my_business_card">personal business
card</a>, complete with contact information, QR code (generated by <a
href="https://github.com/whomwah/rqrcode">rqrcode</a>), my logo (which is
defined as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system">Lindenmayer-system</a>
generated in-place) and its own source code on the back, which is a ruby script
that generates the SVG image that... well, you get the drift. Since it uses
<code>open($0).read</code> I wouldn't suggest it is a true
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)">quine</a>, but the
card is self-replicating nonetheless.</p>

<p>Why? Because sometimes it's just fun to do design the nerdy way :)</p>
