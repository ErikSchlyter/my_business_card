Business card bootstrapped in Ruby code
=======================================

A ruby script that generates the SVG image that is my [personal business
card](http://erikschlyter.github.com/my_business_card/), complete with contact
information, QR code (generated by
[rqrcode](https://github.com/whomwah/rqrcode)), my logo (which is defined as a
[Lindenmayer-system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) generated in-place)
and its own source code on the back, which is a ruby script that generates the
SVG image that... well, you get the drift. Since it uses
<code>open($0).read</code> I wouldn't suggest it is a true
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)">quine</a>, but the card
is self-replicating nonetheless.

Why? Because sometimes it's just fun to do design the nerdy way :)
