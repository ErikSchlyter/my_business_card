My self-replicating business card.
==================================

It is a ruby script that generates the SVG image that is my [personal business
card](http://erikschlyter.github.com/my_business_card/), complete with contact
information, QR code (generated by
[rqrcode](https://github.com/whomwah/rqrcode)), my logo (generated in-place as
an L-system) and its own source code on the back, which is a ruby script that
generates the SVG image that... well, you get the drift.  Since it uses open($0)
I wouldn't suggest it is a true quine, but the card is self-replicating
nonetheless.

Why? Because sometimes it's just fun to do stuff the nerdy way.
